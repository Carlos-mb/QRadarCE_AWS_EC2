How to install QRadar CE in AWS EC2 instance

In order to get the IBM Certified Analyst - Security QRadar SIEM and pass the exam C1000-139 I needed to practice at home. 

But the high requirements of the VM to be able to run all Apps and Extension we're not achievable by my home computer.

I tried to install the QRadar Community Edition OVA in Amazon and I had to overcome some difficulties.

In this video I summarize the entire process, hoping will be useful for those who are in the same situation and need to practice with QRadar.
